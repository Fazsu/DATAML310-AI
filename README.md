### A DATAML300 - AI course Repository

There are four different applications of AI:
# [Kevin Bacon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)
Using Breadth-first search, the algorithm tries to find the *shortest* path from movies where the actors have worked together.
For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”

There are two different datasets **LARGE** and **SMALL**, the datasets consist of three CSV files *people*, *movies* and *stars*.
Each contains files with the same names, and the same structure, but small is a much smaller dataset for ease of testing and experimentation.

# [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)
An AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object.

# [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
A simple AI opponent for TicTacToe.
### Note this is not implemented.

# Parser
A simple text parsing algorithm that uses a language model that uses [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).
